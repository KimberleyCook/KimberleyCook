- 🙋‍♀️ Pronouns : She/her
- 📍 Locations: Chamonix and London

I am a software engineer and codebar Director. I worked in London as a software engineer for 8 years before moving to the snowy French Alps. I have worked in agencies, publishing houses, product focused companies and more recently as a freelancer. I now work full time running [codebar](https://codebar.io/), a charity that offers free programming workshops for minority group members in tech. Over the span of 10 years, codebar has ran more than 2,000 events and has created a global community of over 24,000 people. This started a hobbie because I wanted to make tech more diverse
